[00:08.62] Ahhh! Such a beautiful day, uh (yeah)
[00:10.88] The sun's shining in a beautiful way, uh (whoo)
[00:13.29] Gonna take a shower, brush my teeth and
[00:15.00] Life is ultimately meaningless
[00:16.73] Uhh... Uhh...
[00:23.23] 
[00:17.86] But I'll get out of the house
[00:19.66] Get on the road, top down, hands out
[00:21.49] Put on my favorite song and nod to the rhythm
[00:23.42] The planet's being destroyed by your carbon emissions
[00:49.92] 
[00:26.18] But I- I-, I'll head to class
[00:27.88] Try my best on every test 'til I pass
[00:29.66] And my grades are screaming in my face, hey
[00:32.63] 98 percent of what you learn is a waste
[00:52.13] 
[00:34.43] I get to hang out with all my friends (yeah)
[00:37.04] My friends are the friendliest friends
[00:39.07] Can't think of a better way to spend my time
[00:40.95] Your brain is flawed, and all your friends will die
[00:43.09] Never mind!
[00:48.59] 
[00:43.78] I'm alive in the greatest nation!
[00:45.43] So proud of the exploitation of natives
[00:47.66] This graceful bird means freedom for all
[00:49.50] Tell that to the slaves, and bald eagles aren't bald
[01:15.50] 
[00:52.07] I can live in the moment, milk every second
[00:53.98] At any time you could get clinical depression
[00:56.31] But I'll just be happy, no matter what's in store
[00:58.37] It's quite genetic, and we have no cure
[01:00.10] Uh, at least
[01:06.10] 
[01:00.75] We are young
[01:02.44] Not for long
[01:03.15] Life is fun
[01:04.48] It only goes downhill
[01:06.07] We gotta make the most of it! Make the most of it!
[01:08.54] Or you'll regret it
[01:18.04] 
[01:09.77] We are young
[01:11.07] For now
[01:11.98] Life is fun
[01:14.03] For some people
[01:14.53] We gotta make the most of it! Make the most of it!
[01:17.48] Good luck
[01:21.98] 
[01:18.56] Woo! I got a brand new job today! (Yeah)
[01:20.82] Doin stuff that'll help the economy (uh)
[01:22.97] I'll save money and buy things at the store
[01:24.72] Banks can crash and capitalism is flawed
[01:44.72] 
[01:26.76] And it's all because of my hard work
[01:29.00] And the thousand advantages you lucked into at birth
[01:31.27] I put a lotta effort in my resume!
[01:33.43] Good thing you don't have a black person's name
[01:56.93] 
[01:35.56] I'm proud to be a functioning member of society
[01:38.06] Finally, I can be the citizen I dream to be
[01:40.21] Part of the community, contribute with my tax
[01:42.19] What could possibly stop me?
[01:43.63] The shrinking middle class
[01:56.63] 
[01:44.62] I've at least got a nice stable job
[01:46.47] Until it's outsourced to China or replaced by a robot
[01:48.92] Oh God! Well, then I could relax a bit
[01:50.73] You'll be empty with nothing to distract from it
[02:14.73] 
[01:53.04] But man, I'm a passionate graduate
[01:54.83] I can be different, and I have a career paths to pick from
[01:57.59] I could be a rapper or an animator if I'm lucky
[01:59.89] Neither of those will make you happy, trust me
[02:22.89] 
[02:01.99] I'm able to choose what I pursue (yeah)
[02:04.06] You're a slave to people born richer than you
[02:06.26] Then screw it, I'll keep going in
[02:08.33] Then I'll party on the weekend and sing, no, oh, oh oh
[02:12.04] Thanks to autotune
[02:21.04] 
[02:12.94] We are young
[02:14.12] Not for long
[02:15.07] Life is fun
[02:16.38] It only goes downhill
[02:18.00] We gotta make the most of it! Make the most of it!
[02:20.65] Or you'll regret it
[02:30.15] 
[02:21.60] We are young
[02:23.18] We still die
[02:24.06] Life is fun
[02:25.38] Until you die
[02:26.77] We gotta make the most of it! Make the most of it
[02:29.33] Because you'll die
[02:38.33] 
[02:30.40] Life is a wonder
[02:31.23] You'll never know the answer
[02:32.50] Nature is a miracle
[02:33.82] Natural disasters
[02:34.83] It's good to be alive
[02:35.64] You could wake up with cancer
[02:36.94] But I'm healthy
[02:37.61] Healthy people still get cancer
[02:53.11] 
[02:39.06] I love this show
[02:39.98] It's the last episode
[02:41.36] The sun is shining
[02:42.39] It's going to explode
[02:43.18] Every species is beautiful and unique, though
[02:45.55] Children have malaria thanks to mosquitoes
[03:06.55] 
[02:47.98] I met a cute girl with a ponytail
[02:49.64] Statistically, that relationship is going to fail
[02:51.82] I have a wonderful family, it's like no other
[02:53.92] You're not special, and one day you'll bury your mother
[02:56.58] No matter what, I can find a home!
[02:58.67] We, Will All, Die, Alone
[03:10.67] 
[03:00.74] There's amazing potential in every human on Earth
[03:02.66] There's no escaping the heat death of the universe
[03:05.05] I don't have to live life based on negative parts
[03:07.44] No matter how bad they are, they're just thoughts
[03:31.94] 
[03:10.10] Yeah, that's fair
[03:10.66] Wait, really?
[03:11.71] Yeah, that seems reasonable
[03:12.87] Wait, wait, wait, wait but you were just telling me to-
[03:14.43] Whatever man, I dunno, live your life how you want
[03:15.88] I'm not forcing you to do anything, I'm just saying
[03:18.31] Oh...
[03:20.44] Well in that case...
[03:30.44] 
[03:22.72] We are young!
[03:25.01] Life is fun!
[03:27.86] We gotta make the most of it! Make the most of it!
[03:52.86] 
[03:31.36] We are young!
[03:33.75] Life is fun!
[03:36.61] We gotta make the most of it! Make the most of it!
[03:39.07] Enjoy it while it lasts
